# Multiple_Disease_Prediction
This project aims to predict three different diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. The predictions are made using machine learning models trained on relevant datasets. The project also includes a Streamlit web application (`app.py`) that integrates all three disease predictors into a single user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Diabetes Predictor**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input features such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
- **Heart Disease Predictor**: Predicts the risk of heart disease based on various risk factors including cholesterol levels, age, gender, etc.
- **Kidney Disease Predictor**: Predicts the probability of kidney disease based on attributes like serum creatinine, blood glucose, age, etc.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Combines all three disease predictors into a single app for easy access and user interaction.
